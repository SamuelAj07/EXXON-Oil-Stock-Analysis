## Project Overview

This project delivers an end-to-end Oil Stock Price Analysis conducted using both Microsoft Excel and Power BI, analyzing and visualizing complex relationships across price movements, trading volume, volatility, seasonality, and time-based behaviors.

The analytical objective is to transform historical stock data into clear, actionable insights that support investment decisions, risk assessment, and market timing strategies. This project demonstrates strong capabilities in data preparation, analytical reasoning, visualization design, and business-oriented storytelling

## Data Preparation

In the initial data cleaning phase, the following tasks were performed:

i. Handled missing values

ii. Standardized text

iii. Consistency Across Datasets
